Focus on capturing the essence of the scene with loose, expressive brushstrokes that emphasize rhythm and mood. In the foreground, depict floating lotus leaves and delicate blooms using translucent ink washes, allowing white spaces to suggest light and reflection. In the middle ground, include the iconic "Three Pools Mirroring the Moon" pagodas rising from the lake, their forms defined by bold yet fluid brushstrokes that convey depth and shadow. Behind them, highlight the Duan Bridge (断桥), arching gracefully over the water with drooping willow branches painted in fine, calligraphic lines to suggest movement and softness.  Use varying ink densities to create atmospheric perspective, blending distant mountains into misty grays and negative space. Avoid rigid outlines; instead, let forms dissolve softly into the paper, evoking the dreamy, ethereal quality of classic ink art. Ensure the overall composition balances asymmetry and negative space, reflecting the principles of traditional Chinese painting.</div>
